Dependencies:
* JQuery

Please feel free to recommend changes, this project is really in it's infancy.
As in I needed to build this for a project and now within the same day it is,
itself, a project.

I plan on adding all sorts of cool functionality.  Such as the ability to 
submit a json navigation map that will be used to provide easy redirect navigation.

So for instance if you stored this json object for use by the tool:

{"pages" : {
  "Home" : {
    "object":"#about_us",
    "object":"#contact_form"
  },
  "Contact" : {
    "object":"#email_address",
    "object":"#location_map"
  }
}

scrollto-nav will know that when you click on "Location Map" in the menu while 
on the home page, it will automatically know to first redirect you to the parent
page and then scroll to the proper position.  My idea being that you wouldn't have
to provide a redirect URL in the function because it would know what to do.  So 
stay tuned, cool stuff coming soon!
